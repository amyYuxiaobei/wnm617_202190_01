    <p>Hello, my name is Amy. I am a front end engineer based in Seattle. I enjoy front end development because I can combine my tech skills and 
        user experience skills together to generate some product that serves people around the world. I have been in the front end role for 5 years.
        MA in AAU is my second master degree. In the future, I want to obtain a doctor degree in user expeirence area.

        In my spare time, I enjoy classical music, opera, ballet. My favorite place to visit in Seattle is SAM(Seattle Art Museum), Benaroya Hall, Pacific Northwest Ballet.
        Those are always the places that give me inspirations.
